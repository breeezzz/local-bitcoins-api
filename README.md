local-bitcoin-api
=================

Python tools for using the Local Bitcoins API and make payments using OKPay.

This is still a work in progress until OKPay have provided a test account for development.

The code will consist of a Local Bitcoins API wrapper, an OKPay API wrapper, and a listener to wait for payment confirmation messages from OKPay.
